The Art Atlas

A Node.js web app that uses Mapbox GL JS to create an interactive map of art around the world. 

The map includes markers for different types of art, such as short stories, films, and music. When you click on a marker, a pop-up will appear with more information about the art, such as the title, author, and description.

## Features

- Zoom and pan the map
- Click on markers to view more information about the art
- Filter the markers by type
